The VtuberWiki will take `60%` of the donation, and donate it to the Transgender and LGBTQ+ community.

As outlined in the `support_embed` of the discord bot:

```
In the face of numerous cases of fatal violence targeting transgender and queer communities, our unwavering mission is to stand as allies for the LGBTQ+ community. The visionary mind behind the Vtuber Wiki, [@withervt](https://twitter.com/withervt), is a proud Trans Woman herself.

We commit 60% of our donations to support impactful charities such as:

    The Attic Youth Center
    Sage
    OutRight Action International
    Lambda Literary

    And many more!

If you share our commitment to creating a safer and more inclusive world, we invite you to contribute. Click the button below to make a donation and join us in fostering positive change!
