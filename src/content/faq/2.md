The VtuberWiki will take `60%` of the donation, and donate it to the Transgender and LGBTQ+ community.

As outlined in the `support_embed` of the discord bot:


In the face of numerous cases of fatal violence targeting transgender and queer communities, our unwavering mission is to stand as allies for the LGBTQ+ community. The visionary mind behind the Vtuber Wiki, [@yamideveloper](https://twitter.com/yamideveloper), is a proud Trans Woman herself.

We commit 60% of our donations to support impactful charities such as:
            
The Attic Youth Center
Sage
OutRight Action International
Lambda Literary
            
And many more!
            
If you share our commitment to creating a safer and more inclusive world, we invite you to contribute. Click the button below to make a donation and join us in fostering positive change!
