VRChat is an online virtual world platform created by Graham Gaylor and Jesse Joudrey and operated by VRChat, Inc. The platform allows users to interact with others with user-created 3D avatars and worlds. VRChat is designed primarily for use with virtual reality headsets, such as the Oculus Rift and Oculus Quest series, SteamVR headsets (such as HTC Vive), and Windows Mixed Reality, but is also usable without VR in a "desktop" mode designed for either a mouse and keyboard or gamepad. 


VRChat was first released as a Windows application for the Oculus Rift DK1 prototype on January 16, 2014, and was later released to the Steam early access program on February 1, 2017.

## Features



VRChat's gameplay is similar to that of games such as Second Life and Habbo Hotel. The game is made up of thousands of connected worlds, in which players can interact with each other through virtual avatars. Avatars and worlds are created and uploaded by their users using a software development kit for Unity released alongside the game. Player avatars are capable of supporting lip syncing, eye tracking, and blinking, in addition to mimicking head and hand motion. Trends and variations of avatars spread through the community like memes, and avatars themselves are often distributed for free, or sold through online marketplaces such as Booth. 

VRChat is also capable of running in "desktop mode" without a VR headset, which is controlled using either a mouse and keyboard or a gamepad. Some limitations exist in desktop mode, such as the inability to freely move an avatar's limbs, or perform interactions that require more than one hand.

In 2020, VRChat introduced Udon, a visual programming language which uses a node graph system. While still considered alpha software, it became usable on publicly-accessible worlds beginning in April 2020. A third-party compiler, UdonSharp, was developed to allow world scripts to be written in C#. In 2022, support for the Open Sound Control (OSC) protocol was added for more advanced interactions with external software and devices. Later in the year, VRChat began to implement a secondary application—"Creator Companion"—for managing projects and downloading community packages using a Unity Package Manager (UPM)-compatible format. The previous VRChat SDK2 was deprecated in February 2023, with the Udon-based "SDK3" becoming mandatory for all future content.

### Trust and safety

Users of VRChat are classified into various "trust levels", based on factors such as their use of the platform. All users begin at the "Visitor" rank (grey). When promoted to "New User" (blue) rank, they are given the ability to upload their own content using the VRChat SDK. This is followed by "User" (green), "Known User" (orange), "Trusted User" (purple), and friends (yellow). Users can choose to toggle communications, avatars, and avatar features based on their trust level. Additionally, users can gain a "Nuisance" rank (grey) after gaining too many infractions, such as being muted, and having all communications, avatars, and avatar features blocked.

### VRChat Plus

In November 2020, the service announced the VRChat Plus subscription service. On launch, it allows users to display a custom avatar image on their nameplates, increases the number of avatars they can save in their favorites from 50 to 300, grants them an "increased trust rating", and allows them to attach an in-game photo to an invite request. Other exclusive features for subscribers are also in development.

## Hardware support



VRChat has extensive support for a large number of PC-compatible VR headsets and accessories, including Oculus (Rift), and SteamVR-compatible headsets such as the HTC Vive series and Valve Index. VRChat is also available as a native app for Meta Quest, which supports cross-platform play with PC users; due to hardware limitations, only worlds and avatars compiled for Android and optimized within specific constraints can be accessed on the Meta Quest version. In March 2023, it was announced that a version of VRChat was in development for Android touchscreen devices (smartphones and tablets), which is compatible with content built for Meta Quest; it was initially released in a closed beta for VRChat Plus subscribers on August 18, 2023. A future iOS port was also announced.

Finger tracking and gesture recognition is supported on controllers such as the Index Controller and Oculus Touch, allowing users' finger movements to be reflected by their avatar, and hand poses to trigger linked animations (such as a corresponding facial expression). VRChat also supports SteamVR full-body tracking for motion capture of waist and leg motions, typically by using HTC's Vive Tracker peripherals or alternative devices (such as Kinect).

## Community



VRChat's popularity has been attributed to use by YouTubers and Twitch streamers. VRChat has spawned media such as a weekly newspaper in its forums, and talk shows and podcasts dedicated to a discussion of the game.

After an initial wave of viral popularity upon its release, the platform saw a steady increase in concurrent users with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and direct quarantine policies. There were recorded spikes in viewership of VRChat-related Twitch streams in mid-2020 and September 2020. The service reported a record of over 24,000 concurrent users over the Halloween weekend (with over half using it on a VR platform), spurred by holiday events and the recent release of the Oculus Quest 2.

On December 31, 2020, the service recorded a new record of over 40,000 concurrent users for New Year's Eve, to the point that it experienced a major outage around midnight in the Eastern Time Zone due to a security provider having mistaken the surge as a denial-of-service attack.
