### Edit 3D models in real-time

Editing outfits, as well as details in the hair or eyes, has never been easier. Users can check in real-time how their edits are affecting the model directly on the texture, with the 3D preview. (You can draw on both the UV mapped textures and your 3D model directly!) This software supports digital pens and is pressure-sensitive. Furthermore, textures and designs can be arranged in different layers, making it easy for experienced designers to work with.


### An abundance of items, ready to use!

You can start creating right after download: with many ready-to-use preset items, you won’t need to create anything from scratch. There are hairstyles, make-up, outfits, and many more to pick and mix. Furthermore, these items can all be used in whatever arrangement you want!
