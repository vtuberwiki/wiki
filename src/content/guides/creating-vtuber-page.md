Before embarking on the journey to create your VTuber profile on The Vtuber Wiki, let's ensure you have everything you need. Here are the prerequisites for a smooth experience, even if you have no prior experience with GitHub or programming:

1. GitHub Account:

4. Text Editor:

    - Choose a text editor for editing your Markdown files. If you don't have a preferred one, [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is a popular and user-friendly choice.

5. Web Browser:
  
      - Choose a web browser for viewing your VTuber page. If you don't have a preferred one, [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) is a popular and user-friendly choice.

Now that you've gathered the essentials, you're ready to dive into creating your VTuber profile. Follow the step-by-step guide provided earlier, and don't hesitate to refer back to this section if needed.
