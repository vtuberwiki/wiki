<summary>Prerequisites</summary>

Before embarking on the journey to create your VTuber profile on The Vtuber Wiki, let's ensure you have everything you need. Here are the prerequisites for a smooth experience, even if you have no prior experience with GitHub or programming:

1. GitHub Account:
    - If you don't have a GitHub account, [create one](https://github.com/join). This account will be your gateway to managing and contributing to your VTuber page.

    Learn: [Create a GitHub Account](#create-a-github-account)

2. Basic Understanding of Markdown:

    - Familiarize yourself with basic [Markdown syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) since your VTuber profile will be written in this lightweight markup language.

3. Access to Git:

    - Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) on your local machine. Git is the version control system that helps you manage your code changes.

    Learn: [Learn Git](#learn-to-use-git)

4. Text Editor:

    - Choose a text editor for editing your Markdown files. If you don't have a preferred one, [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is a popular and user-friendly choice.

Now that you've gathered the essentials, you're ready to dive into creating your VTuber profile. Follow the step-by-step guide provided earlier, and don't hesitate to refer back to this section if needed.

2. **Navigate to the Directory**:
    
Change your working directory to the `wiki` folder:

## Learn to Use Git

Git is a version control system that helps you manage your code changes. Here's a basic overview of how to use Git:

<details>
<summary>Terminal</summary>

1. **Clone a Repository**:

To get started, you'll need to clone the repository to your local machine. Use the following command:

```bash 
git clone <repository_URL>
```

Replace `<repository_URL>` with the URL of the repository you want to clone.

2. **Navigate to the Directory**:

Once the repository is cloned, navigate to the directory of the repository:

```bash
cd <repository_directory>
```
___

3. **Commit Changes**:

After making changes to your files, you'll need to commit those changes to Git. First, add the files you want to commit:

```bash
git add <file_name>
```

Replace `<file_name>` with the name of the file you want to add. You can also use `.` to add all changed files.

Next, commit the changes:

```bash
git commit -m "feat: Add new feature

Add a descriptive message about the changes you made."
```

> Note: Replace `feat: Add new feature` with the type of change you made (e.g., `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, etc.), and replace the message with a descriptive summary of the changes. Learn: [Commit Message Conventions](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)

___

4. **Push Changes**:

Once your changes are committed, you can push them to the remote repository:

```bash
git push
```

This will push your changes to the default remote repository.

___


5. **Pull Changes**:

If there are changes in the remote repository that you don't have locally, you can pull them:

```bash
git pull
```

This will fetch the changes from the remote repository and merge them into your local branch.

___

6. **Remove Files from Commits**:

If you accidentally added a file to a commit that you don't want to include, you can unstage it:

```bash
git reset HEAD <file_name>
```

Replace `<file_name>` with the name of the file you want to unstage.

These are the basic Git commands to get you started. As you become more familiar with Git, you can explore more advanced features and workflows.
