## Introduction

Mori Calliope (æ£® ã‚«ãƒªã‚ªãƒš) is a captivating female English-speaking Virtual YouTuber associated with Hololive. She made her debut in 2020 as part of Hololive English's first generation, known as "Myth," alongside fellow talents Ninomae Ina'nis, Takanashi Kiara, Watson Amelia, and Gawr Gura.

## Lore

**Background:**
Calliope, or Calli for short, is a shinigamiâ€”a spirit being of death, reminiscent of the Western concept of the Grim Reaper. Although her primary duty involves escorting souls to the afterlife, she is currently on hiatus from this solemn task while fulfilling her role as a Hololive member. She has pledged not to take any lives during her time in the human world.

**Underworld Origins:**
Hailing from the Underworld, the realm of the dead, Calli's unique perspective adds an otherworldly touch to her content. The Underworld, surprisingly, mirrors the aesthetic of the contemporary era, resembling a modern city in many aspects.

**Signature Scythe:**
Calli wields a scythe with a blade made of stainless steel, a formidable tool that she can summon and dismiss at will. This iconic weapon symbolizes her connection to the realm of death and serves as a constant reminder of her responsibilities.

**Pre-VTuber Ventures:**
Before venturing into the world of Virtual YouTubing, Calli had a colorful past. In the Underworld, she juggled two jobs, one of which included a summer stint as a waitress at a restaurant chain. Enduring mistreatment from customers and navigating through numerous mistakes, she persevered to save up enough funds for her dream trip to the "Overworldian" Japan. Once she secured the funds for the cheapest plane ticket, she bid farewell to her Underworld jobs.

**Humanoid Experience:**
Currently residing in a humanoid body, Calli's transition to the human world brought unexpected challenges. Surprisingly, she discovered that her new form requires sleep for optimal functioningâ€”a concept she found bothersome but has adapted to nonetheless.

Whether she's showcasing her musical talents or sharing glimpses of her unique Underworld experiences, Mori Calliope continues to captivate audiences with her distinctive charm and intriguing lore.
