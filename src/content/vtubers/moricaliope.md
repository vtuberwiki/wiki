# Lore
- Calli is a shinigami, a spirit being of death similar to the Western concept of the Grim Reaper. Her purpose is to carry souls of the dead to the afterlife, although she is on hiatus from this job while working as a hololive member, and has promised not to kill anybody.
- She comes from the Underworld, the realm of the dead. The Underworld mimics the aesthetic of the current era, so it looks mostly like a modern city.[88]
- Calli's scythe blade is made of stainless steel. She can summon and dismiss it at will.
- Before she became a Virtual YouTuber in the human world, Calli worked two jobs in the Underworld, one of them a summer job at a restaurant chain as a waitress, in order to save up enough funds to take her dream trip to "Overworldian" Japan. Despite making quite a few mistakes and being mistreated by customers, she stuck through. She quit as soon as she could afford the cheapest plane ticket to Japan.[89]
- Calli currently inhabits a humanoid body. She was surprised to learn that it requires sleep to function, which she found bothersome.
