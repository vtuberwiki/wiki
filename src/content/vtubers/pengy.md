## Who is Pengy?

**PengyVT** is an Australian Vtuber who started out streaming on vrchat and worked their way onto Twitter, meeting up with fellow vtubers and artists, and over time found one artist to bring their first model to life.

It was an orange fox which developed into an elf model with a penguin icon placed on it.

Not too long after the model was completed, another model was in the works and debuting in 2022 with the elf/fox model combo was a very happy day for PengyVT.

Pengy is known to play games such as:
- Zelda
- Banjo Kazooie
- Halo
- Splitgate
- Doom
- LodeRunner
- Mario
- And many other retro games with a few modern-day games thrown in at their own discretion.

Pengy loves cuddles, hugs, making friends, and enjoying being part of an ever-expanding vtuber community.

Pengy is a 33-year-old going by he/him pronouns but tends to use female models and VRChat models because, in his own words, "they just look better overall and help with confidence."

Pengy is a wholesome yet mildly lewd tuber who loves to create content, play games, and love life.
