The Vtuber Wiki project has a rich history that began with [@char32vt (Stella)](https://twitter.com/char32vt), who was associated with HyperStar, a Vtuber Talent Agency. Stella's initial concept for the project took root in the vibrant Vtuber community, but it faced challenges in getting off the ground due to a lack of motivation. However, when the time came for her to disband the Vtuber Talent Agency, Stella found a renewed sense of purpose, ultimately leading to the creation of the **Vtuber Wiki**.

Stella's vision for this wiki was nothing short of ambitious. She aspired to create a comprehensive, all-encompassing repository of information about Vtubers. The goal was to make it a one-stop resource for all things Vtuber-related, ensuring that anyone seeking knowledge about Vtubers would find a wealth of information at their fingertips.

The Vtuber Wiki has grown to encompass various categories, and the project continues to expand its horizons. Some of the key categories on the wiki include:

- [ ] Trusted Artists
- [x] Vtubers
- [x] Software
- [x] Guides

One of the core principles of this project is its unwavering commitment to open-source technology. Stella firmly believes in the power of open-source collaboration and its capacity to foster innovation and community involvement. To further this commitment, the team behind the Vtuber Wiki has developed several open-source projects, including:

- [Main Wiki](https://github.com/vtuberwiki/wiki)
- [Discord Bot](https://github.com/vtuberwiki/bot)

The Vtuber Wiki is a collaborative effort, and we're proud to have dedicated maintainers who work tirelessly to ensure its accuracy and completeness. These contributors are the backbone of the project, and you can see some of our top maintainers in action here:
